Andrew, it's been nearly a year since we last sat down together, a very different time. It was in my London studio and eight days after that you got arrested. What's the year been like for you? It's certainly been an interesting one. I've been constrained this entire year. I spent 93 days in a Romanian dungeon, five months locked in my house and now I'm restrained within the country of Romania. So it's certainly been a turbulent time. The moment you got arrested, it was all pretty dramatic. The video came out, the world saw it, a lot of people smashing into your home. Did you have any inkling, warning that something like this may happen? I knew it. I kept saying before I was arrested on every single podcast I did, I said you get three lives in the world. The first life they're gonna cancel you, they're gonna slander you, they're gonna delete your access to social media so you can't defend yourself. The second life they're gonna try and put you in jail for no reason and if you continue to speak against the power they're gonna assassinate you. I knew I was on my second life, I kept saying it, I knew it was coming. I didn't know the bullshit reason they'd use but I found out once I was in a cell. When you were arrested you didn't actually, you don't speak any Romanian at all and they didn't speak English to you. Correct. So you were taken to a cell, you had no idea what they were alleging you'd done. I was arrested on the 27th of December so because of Christmas and New Year's and other problems they couldn't even translate my paperwork for two weeks. So for the first two weeks I was in a prison cell I had no idea why. I was given papers in Romanian, I could read human trafficking, I understood but I was like human trafficking who, when, what, none of this makes sense. I waited two entire weeks inside of my cell before I was given an English translation and then I realized exactly how ridiculous the whole case was. Just to clarify, I am accused of helping my friends get big on TikTok. That is what I'm accused of. I told some girls I know how to post on TikTok to become viral when I was at the time the most viral person on the planet and they are saying I'm a human trafficker for that reason. It is insane. Well we'll come to what you've been accused of. It's more serious than the way you've categorized it but we'll come to that. There is a lot of speculation that the reason the Romanian authorities knew that you were back because you were en route I believe to Dubai for a New Year's Eve party is that you were interacting with Greta Thunberg on social media and you had a pizza in front of you which came from a well-known Romanian pizza store. Is there any truth to that? I don't think so. I think that they know where I was. A lot of people knew where I was and they had instructions from higher up to teach me a lesson. I was on my second life and that's exactly what I'm going through right now. There's an irony to your situation because you always said the reason you came to Romania was precisely because you thought you could avoid being in this situation. Well I loved Romania and it's a strong Christian nation with strong traditional values. I want a life where I'm left alone by government. I don't believe in big government. I'm trying to avoid that. It felt like Romania was a place which was very safe societally and the government was not too interested or involved in people's lives but things change. Also your freedom and your ability to speak the truth is heavily correlated to your insignificance. When you become large and people start listening to what you say, you soon realize you no longer have freedom of speech and it doesn't matter where you are on the planet. If they decide you must be assassinated, you will be assassinated. You in jail. What was that like? Romanian jail is not English jail. Describe it. What was the cell like? I have to be careful what I say because I don't want to insult the Romanian justice system which I'm still beholden to. However, it's exactly as bad as people would expect it to be. Luckily it was in the winter so the cockroaches were not too bad. It was also during Ramadan so I didn't have to eat so much which was helpful because of the situation. I think the most stressful thing about it is I had no idea how long I was gonna be in there for. I was dragged from my house. I was given papers in Romanian. I didn't know why I was there. I found out why I was there and it was garbage. I couldn't seem to get out. I could have been held for years. It's very stressful and the best thing you can do is turn to God and train as hard as possible. I did thousands of push-ups a day. Were you in solitary in this period, three months? No, I wasn't in solitary the entire month, the entire time. Sometimes I was by myself, sometimes I was with other guys and sometimes I was with my brother. When you were on your own, were they keeping you in there for 24 hours a day? Were you allowed out? No, I wasn't allowed out. There was no yard time. It was 24 hours a day locked in a single room, probably three or four steps large and you do nothing but stare at the wall. How many days did you do that for on your own? 11, 12. I mean that's a pretty grim scenario for anyone. Life's grim. For you, always being Mr. Confident, you said interestingly that you wouldn't categorize what you were feeling as depression because you don't believe in the concept of depression. You and I have argued about that before but it sounds to me from what I've seen you say when you talked about this that that was pretty close to depression what you were feeling. Life's grim and if you want to be a superhero you have to understand in every single superhero movie he is losing for 80% of the movie. He's going to suffer for the majority of the movie before he wins at the end. I've always won exceptional life peers and I'm not a coward and I knew that by telling the truth about certain issues I was going to pay the price for it. So I won't say that I deserve to be in jail but I certainly put myself in there by telling the truth to the populace and telling the truth and living. But when you're on your own in that cell, what were you thinking? It's a long time to self-reflect, right? It certainly is and I think my number one concern when I was in jail despite the fact that my situation was dire were my concerns as a man and all the people I have to take care of and my children and my family and the people I pay for and all the people who work for me and truthfully I wasn't worried about myself I was worried about everybody else and I think that's the true masculine frame. Did you get emotional? Did you shed tears in your cell? I'm an emotional man. I think men are hyper emotional. We just have to control it. I was extremely busy inside of my jail cell. I had lots of push-ups to do. I was very concerned about the people on the outside. I was trying my best to get out. It's difficult for me to answer the question because it was a interesting frame of mind. I knew that God was watching and I had to perform. It's very difficult for me to go through life saying I'm the top G, I'm this, I'm that and speak about mental resilience and mental toughness and then the second I'm thrown inside of a solitary confinement cell, cower out. I'm not that person. There's some other people who talk about mental toughness and want to give advice and when bad things happen to them they end up addicted to prescription drugs. I'm not a coward and I'm not a liar. No, but it would be perfectly natural to be emotional in that scenario and there's no shame in admitting that. I was emotional. I missed people. I missed them and I knew they missed me so I felt a long, I felt a strong sense of missing. You cried? There were tears that ran down my face but I did not cry. I mean that's crying. I would disagree. Because you you're worried about admitting that you think you're sound. Absolutely not. That's a perfectly fine scenario to cry in but I think the act of crying is an act of desperation. To sit and to cry is an act in and of itself. To do push-ups, thinking of your children, with tears running down your face but you're concerned with finishing as many push-ups as possible within that day, I do not consider that crying. I consider that tears running down my face. When you found out what they were alleging you'd done, sexual assault, exploitation and so on, what did you feel about that? What was your first reaction? My first reaction was, ah, the standard playbook. The standard playbook for anybody who speaks up against power is sexual exploitation. Isn't it the normal one they go to? Can't we name like 10 or 15 people right now they hit them with this exact same garbage? Name a full-grown man who's 36 or 37 years old who's not had sexual relations with a woman at some point in past and the way the Matrix works is they lie by omission, right? They just hit Russell Brand with it. I think they hit P. Diddy with it this morning. Julian Assange just got hit with it. He's still in a cell. But lots of people get hit with these allegations and it turns out to be true. A lot of people get hit with them and they turn out to be false. But you're sort of trying to make out all the people you just named innocent. You don't know that. Of course I don't know that but a lot of people get hit and it turns out to be false. Why would you assume they're innocent? Well I'll tell you why. Because the way the Matrix operates is it choose something which is heinous. If they accused me of drug dealing, nobody would care. They choose something which is heinous so the process itself is a punishment. They damage your reputation throughout the process regardless of whether it's successful or not. Then what they do is they lie by omission. They throw you in a cell and they contact everyone you've ever interacted with. 2,000 people I know were called and they were looking for one person to say they're a victim. By the way, they failed. They did not even find one. But if they did, they would then say Andrew Tate's victim. He's a sexual assaulter and they would remove the testimony of the 1,999 people who said I'm a very nice man. Lie by omission and then they put together this entire package used the mainstream media to convince the world that you deserve to be in jail and that is how the Matrix operates. I mean to be clear, I don't know if you're guilty or not. I do. You're perfectly entitled to say that and you know. Of course I know. But I don't know and I will await any trial that comes to see what comes out of the trial and see what happens. So I'm not going to prejudge the trial. I'm not going to judge you and say I think you're guilty. I don't know. We are where we are. You've been charged with serious crimes and it's likely you'll face a trial and we'll see how that all plays out obviously. Going back to jail, how were you treated by other people? Everybody in jail was extremely apologetic to me. All of the staff, the police officers, everyone who worked in the jail, the person who served me my meal, everybody was very sorry for what happened to me. They made it very clear they knew it was garbage and they were apologetic. That was the only vibe I could give you. They were kind of like listen you got too big. I'm sorry. This is how things work and sorry here's your meal. Nobody had any real problem with me. None of the prisoners had a problem with me. Did you get into any fights? There was a couple scenarios where violence could have occurred but I think once people realize that violence is a certainty and that you do not operate under a fearful realm they often aren't so interested. So people threatened you? I wouldn't say they threatened me but they would have liked to have got the opportunity to threaten me. And what happened? And they realized that would have been a bad decision. And all in all... What did you say to them? Because you don't speak Romanian. I didn't. You're right. I actually used a quote from Street Fighter. I quoted Dowson and I said that they do not understand the secrets of yoga fire because I knew they had no idea what I was talking about. It was near the washing machines and they looked at me like I was completely crazy and they walked away. There's more than one person. Correct. And they made it clear what? That they wanted to... I have to be careful what I say because I'm still beholden to the Romanian judicial system. But that's just an incident in jail. Correct. An incident report was written and it's better I don't mention it. But there was a direct threat? I've had threats, yeah, and I have threats every single day of my life and I think jail is a hyper pressurized version of reality and you need to have an extremely strong mind so you don't attack yourself and an extremely strong body so others don't attack you. And I understood that there was a threat of violence at all times and I just decided to go through life extremely respectfully but make it clear if that's a decision somebody else wants to make that I'm prepared to partake. One of the things I would think about other than my family, immediate family, but one particular member of my family if I found myself in jail would be my mother and what she would be feeling and what she'd be thinking. She's been incredibly supportive to me. I know yours has to you. Did you think about your mother? I was extremely concerned for her. I was concerned because the media establishment were hounding her. She was obviously very worried but she knew she raised strong sons but we're her number one protectors and I was concerned for her. I wasn't concerned for myself in jail. I didn't even suffer in jail as much as I did when I got out. I didn't have nightmares in jail. I had nightmares once I left jail. I was in the middle of a battle. I don't think you get PTSD while you're fighting. You get it afterwards. I was in the middle of a battle trying to make sure that everybody I love and care about is taken care of and trying to make sure that bills are paid. Please understand the day I was arrested, which is a year ago, every single bank account that I have was frozen. All of my assets were taken. I haven't had a dollar of money. You had 10 cars taken. 15. 15 cars and how many properties? 15 cars, 6 properties, 20 diamond watches, gold bars, cash, land, every single bank account, millions and millions. What was the total value of everything they seized? 16, 17 million pounds. Yeah. And they took all of it and I still don't have access to any of these things. I mean as we're doing this interview, you're expecting to hear sometime today as to whether you may get those possessions back. Is it all or nothing? Do you get it all back or nothing? Correct. As we sit here, the judge is deciding whether I get all of my items returned or I get none of them returned. And truthfully, under the law, I should have never had them taken in the first place. So we're gonna see what the judge decides. And I have to put my faith within the Romanian judicial system. I have no other choice. I'm not a coward. I'm not gonna run. But let's not talk about the Romanian judicial system. Let's talk about the judicial systems of the world. I've recently seen some very scary decisions in America, in England, in these Western democratic nations. You see people doing 20 years for attending peaceful protests. So you start to sit and wonder when you're in these situations, what is a trial? What is a judge? What is this? Is it just people in which peaceful process you're talking about? There's been a few. And who's got 20 years for attending a peaceful protest? I don't want to say names. I saw it somewhere on Twitter. Somebody attended, I think it was a protest, a pro-Trump protest, and they ended up getting 20 years. Well, if you're talking about the January 6th riots, they were riots where people died. Well, it's interesting. They're not peaceful protests. Well, it's interesting because the world is actually very nuanced. And what I tried... Well, that wasn't nuanced. That was a huge mob of people attacking the US Capitol. Well, what I tried to do is I try to look at a broad spectrum of events. And I try to put things into a nuanced view. And I don't try and take an instant black or white point of view on things. And the fact that BLM were rioting and destroying the entire nation for months and during that exact week, and then some other people got together with an opposing political view and are facing serious prison time for doing less damage than BLM did. I find that kind of scary. Well, people did die. Well, in a democratic nation, we should all be the same under the law. Just to be clear, on January 6th, people died. People died during BLM. I mean, there are certainly inconsistencies in the way groups of people have been policed. I think that's the same. That's the same whether you're talking about the BLM marches to the pro-Palestinian marches and so on, right? There's a lot of inconsistency. Well, then we agree. Well, there's a lot of inconsistency in global policing, I think. I think that's a perfectly valid thing to say. But the idea that someone's got 20 years for being in a peaceful march is not true. The ones who've got the lengthy prison sentences have been held account for serious crime. I'm not even condoning January 6. I don't even know the ins and outs of January 6. I wasn't there. I'm not saying it should have happened. What I'm saying is exactly what you have said. There seems to be some massive inconsistencies in global policing now. So when you end up in a position where you're speaking against the system, as I do, and you understand that there are massive inconsistencies in policing globally, you start to sit down and seriously wonder if you stand a fair chance of a fair trial in any country on earth. I actually have to give out massive credit to the Romanian judicial system because a judge one day sat down and said, why are these boys in jail and let us go? I don't know if I would have had a fair shot like that in many other nations. When you were released from jail after about three months, what was that feeling like? My brother and I were in the same cell at that time. We were extremely happy. I remember using the last of my mouthwash during the day. I had some rituals to keep me sane and I'd enjoy one swig of mouthwash a day. It's amazing how bored you get when you're staring at cockroaches and even that sensation. So there were literally cockroaches in your cell? Correct. How many at any given time? At night there was a lot of them. Like dozens? Yeah, a few. There was an infestation. We did our best to kill as many as we could. They kept us entertained, but they're annoying to sleep with. But mouthwash was something I enjoyed every day. The sensation of mouthwash made me happy and I remember using all of my mouthwash. And then instantly my brain started turning to all of the things I need to do. I'm a man. I have responsibilities. For 93 days I wasn't working. I started concerning myself with, okay, I'm about to get out of jail. Thank God. I'm gonna leave. Who do I need to take care of? What's paid? Do I have any money left? Are bills due? Is mum okay? Are my children okay? And I just started thinking about work. And as soon as I got out I didn't sleep for three days. How many children do you have? I'm less confidential. Why? Because I have enemies and unfortunately I don't want to give them any information. But you have more than one? I have more than one, correct. So obviously you're caring for your children. I understand that as a father, right? And you have a partner? Yes. Are you married? No. I think I asked you last time and you were a bit cryptic about it. You're not married yet? No. You have a partner who's the mother of your children? Correct. The same woman is the mother of all your kids? It's confidential. It's a bit stupid to say confidential. It is confidential, Piers. It's confidential. I don't think you can marry and have kids with who's confidential, surely? It is for me. Really? Of course. I am basically number one enemy of the state, Piers. Look what they've done to me. What have they put me in jail for? At the beginning of this garbage people were sitting there thinking maybe he's a human trafficker. It's been a year. Who? Show me a picture. Show me a video. Who's even a victim? There's nobody. The whole thing is made up, Piers. We're going to come to what they say you've done, right? I'm just curious. You come out of prison. You've got no ability to access any of your assets. How have you been functioning financially since then? I believe in prayer and I trust in God. Prayer doesn't pay the bills. And I do my very best. Prayer doesn't pay the bills. Unfortunately, absolutely everything I own was seized by the Romanian state so I'm just gonna have to survive and do my very best. But how? I'm doing my very best, Piers. Have you got wealthy benefactors helping you? I'm doing my very best. I wish I had wealthy benefactors. I wish I had people on my side. You can't function on on no income at all. Seems you can. How? I'm doing my very best, Piers. What does that mean? It means I'm doing my very best. Absolutely everything I own is taken by the Romanian state. I don't have anything they don't have. How do you pay for food? I just have to do my best. What does that mean? It means that I believe in God and I pray. Well, God's not going to pay your bills. God has been paying my bills so far, it seems. It's amazing how far faith can take you. It's often when you have absolutely nothing left people turn to faith but you should turn to faith first and you should believe in God when things are good and then he will be there when times are bad. Initially, you were put on this sort of rolling 30-day house arrest and they kept renewing that month by month by month and then in June, you and your brother and two others were formally charged with rape, trafficking, and forming an organized crime group to sexually exploit women. There were seven alleged victims named in the indictment. You said at the time, I look forward to being found innocent. You said earlier, who are these women? Well, there are seven named in the indictment. Yeah, have you seen the videos of them on the internet saying, we're not victims, they made us be victims, we told them we weren't victims? Well, that will all presumably be analyzed in a trial. Do you know when the trial may be? I have no idea. Do you believe it will happen? I'm not sure. It could get to a point where a judge anytime before the trial decides this case is garbage and throws it away. If you ask me what I believe happened, it's very simple. They threw me in a jail cell knowing they had no case, knowing they had no victims, but they thought if they plastered me all over the MSM and they say that I'm a bad person and they call enough people, they will find the case they want. They couldn't find it. You name the date they charged me. They had six months to charge me. Usually, the Romanian state, even the American Embassy confirms to me, charges within 30 days. With me, they used all six months trying to build a case and find actual victims of an actual crime. They couldn't. They charged me on the very last possible day they could, unless they'd have to drop the entire case, and they charged me with garbage because they have nothing, there are no victims, I've done nothing wrong, and they've tried very hard. Let me say something very pertinent to the audience here. It's very difficult when you're thrown inside of a jail cell. You do not have access to social media. You do not have access to money. The entire MSM establishment are calling you a bad person. Hotlines are set up saying, if Andrew Tate's ever hurt you, call this hotline. You're a rich person where people may want to get money from you and exploit you and extract resource from you, and they're sitting there calling anyone you've ever known. They called my gardener's daughter, who I've never even spoken to, asking if I've ever done anything wrong to her or said anything wrong to her, trying to find victims of a crime that don't exist. It's actually a miracle from God that no one's come out trying to extract money from me. The whole thing is garbage. They could do this to anybody. Peers, they could do this to you. They could put you in a cell, put all over the media you're a sexual exploiter, and for three months talk about how bad you are, when you can't defend yourself, and call everyone you've ever interacted with, and if anybody you were ever rude to once decides they want a payday or some fame, they can use it against you. It's insane. The Romanian authorities' prosecution files accuse you of using verbal and physical abuse to keep women in line, taking 50%, I believe, of the women's online income, although I believe that figure could vary, could be up to 80%. Is that right? No. They accuse me of exploiting women who did TikTok. The same women who say we were not exploited, he just told us how to do TikTok. Also, in the prosecution file, if you want to talk about it, there's not a single bank transfer. There's not a single piece of evidence for any money. So I'm accused of making money from TikTok, but they haven't found any money. There's no money, and the victims are saying, I didn't exploit them to do TikTok. The whole thing is a joke. What is, I think, problematic for you is the war room, which was miscategorized and misunderstood. It was called the war room. Correct. Okay. And it had a lot of people who were dubbed the generals who ran the war room for you, and the war room had five to six hundred members who paid, I think, six thousand plus dollars to be a member of this. And when you saw the logs of the web chats between people from the war room to each other, a lot of it made disturbing reading. Were you disturbed by it when you read that? Firstly, a lot of that is bullshit. A lot of that's fake. You think that literally those logs are fake? Absolutely. But the BBC verified them. The BBC verified them. Are they the same people who verified the vaccine? Those people. They're liars, firstly. A lot of them are fake. Were you disturbed by anything you read? No, because a lot of it's real, firstly. Secondly, there's 4,000 members in the war room. Thirdly, the war room is about masculine personal development. We talk about fitness, making money, strength. We talk about very important things. There's 4,000 members inside. If you're telling me that amongst 4,000 members was 24-hour chat, seven days a week for the last five years, they've managed to find two guys talking locker room talk, and that somehow offends the world, then nobody understands how the world works. That's not why I was in jail. It's nothing to do with the war room. I was in jail because I spoke against power, because I told the truth about COVID, because I told the truth about the war in Ukraine, because I told the truth about all of these things. I don't understand why people would want to put you in jail for giving your opinions about COVID or Ukraine. Why would they? Why wouldn't they? Why would they? Why would they say that Andrew Tait's opinion is so important on Ukraine that we have to put him in jail? I don't buy that. Okay, because I was the most Googled man on the planet and I had a huge affinity with the most troublesome demographic for the Matrix, which is the young masculine youth, the people who you need to die in wars, the people who you need to sigh off into being slaves to build the roads while telling them that they're not allowed a point of view and they're not allowed an opinion on anything. And I was saying things which was going against the narrative. And the Matrix, the way it operates is it uses the MSM to purport lies, to inject slave programming into people's brains so that we live lives which are not good for us but are good for them. And I was sitting there unplugging it. Why would they sit there and say we've put together this massive psy-op, we're going to convince everybody to inject themselves with poison and we're going to lock everyone in their houses and it's all a lie and we're going to let this one lie that everyone listens to. Andrew, Andrew, it wasn't all a lie. Yes it was. It wasn't. There was a new novel coronavirus. Okay, I'll tell you what the facts were and you can then laugh at them if you wish. But there was a novel coronavirus, COVID-19. It was killing thousands of people a day. Really? Yes, absolutely. And I know people who died. I know people who died before coronavirus. I'm sure people died lots of things but it was killing exponentially thousands and thousands of people and then vaccines were developed at very high speed and they managed to save, in my estimation, millions of lives. You may not agree with that. Absolutely. But those are facts as assumed by the body of scientific and medical experts in the world. The body of scientific and medical experts, you mean the Matrix. What is the Matrix? The Matrix are a bunch of people who could come up with studies from the sky to say anything they want them to say so they can use the MSM to purport garbage inside of people's minds. You end up locked in your house, clapping for the NHS like a performing seal, injecting yourself with experimental poison for the ninth time. It's a lie. There was no reason to lock everyone in their house. More people died from missed cancer appointments than anyone ever died of COVID. People always got the sniffles before COVID and they've always got it since. Let me ask you a question. Where has COVID gone? Diseases don't go away. Where's COVID gone? COVID strains have got milder as indeed flu did. So it's gone away. The flu pandemic about a hundred years ago killed 50 to 100 million people and it's got steadily milder over the decades since. This is normal medical science pathway for most pandemics, right? So on that, I mean, your sort of Karstein, it was all Matrix, MSM nonsense is palpably untrue. Well, I'll tell you why that's not true. Let me tell you my personal experience with COVID. I'm an extremely logical person. At the beginning when everyone was dying, dropping dead in the streets in China, which I never saw by the way, funny, and Italian hospitals were full, English hospitals were never full, funny. Me and my brother sat there and said, if this disease is so deadly and can damage us as strong military age males and the world is over, so there's no point in hiding in our house, we decided to go to Sweden. On day one of COVID, day one when everyone still believed, we went to Sweden. Why does no one talk about the fact that Sweden was open the entire time? Why does no one talk about the fact they didn't have masks or lockdown or vaccines? My brother and I partied in nightclubs seven days a week for three entire months while everyone in England was locked in our house. Sweden actually had a number of restrictions. Not when I was there, it was open. Not as draconian as we had in the UK and there are certainly legitimate questions to ask about the scale of our lockdowns. I think people panicked. They saw what was happening in Italy, which had the second best medical healthcare system in the world and people were dying in massive numbers and the hospitals were overrun. So people may have panicked. Did you hear about the guy who died in a motorcycle crash and it was a COVID death? You hear about that one? Well, there was certainly... Downing Street didn't seem very concerned. There was a long debate about people dying of COVID or with COVID, I know all that, but the bottom line for me, it is indisputable that COVID was a deadly pandemic that killed a lot of people. It turned out a lot of older people more than young people, but they didn't know that at the time, not for a long period. The vaccine saved millions of people's lives. There are legitimate questions about some of the boosters, about some of the side effects of the vaccines, as there are, by the way, with all vaccines. But the idea that COVID is some invention by the Matrix to suppress and control its people is for the birds, Andrew. It's for the birds. It seems the birds and I are friends. I don't think a smart guy like you actually believes that. Of course, I absolutely believe that. One of my problems I have with you is that I think you are intelligent, but I think you also adopt positions that you know are going to get the anti-Matrix mob inflamed. And it's just these all-encompassing views you have. COVID was a load of nonsense. Vaccines are all dangerous and killing more people than they save. I never said that. I said the COVID vaccine. Well, COVID vaccine, you don't think they worked? No, of course not, because the idea of a vaccine... Of course they worked. The word vaccine in and of itself is that you get... They save millions of lives. If you get a vaccine, you do not get the disease. They changed the definition of vaccine in the dictionary so they could continue to inject us with this pointless poison. I had the vaccine for polio. I've never had polio. You got the vaccine for COVID and you're bragging online how you have COVID for the eighth time, but it's not that bad because you've had six injections. It's insane. And please understand my position. Please understand that I'm a person who doesn't believe any of these studies. Don't believe any of this garbage. Don't believe the Matrix. I'm a person who was in Sweden for three months as everyone was afraid, locked in their houses, partying at will. And it was perfectly fine. They had a lower death rate than the UK. They had a much higher death rate than their neighbouring countries in Scandinavia. Did you know that? They had a lower death rate than the UK. Did you know that? No, I didn't know that. It doesn't matter to you. Of course not. So you wouldn't compare them to their immediate neighbours. You'd only compare them to a country in the UK. If you think lockdowns worked, Piers, if you think lockdowns... I think lockdowns were only acceptable as an immediate panic move, which it was, before there were vaccines. The moment they had a successful vaccine program that worked, then there was no justification for further lockdowns. You're a very important person and you're very well respected. I'm not important. I'm a journalist. No, you're very important and you're very well respected within the UK and you've been famous for a very long time. Were you invited to the party at Downing Street or were you not in that sort of thing? No. No? That's a shame. They seemed very concerned about COVID on the TV and they didn't seem to give a shit as soon as the TV was on. I thought that was disgraceful and I thought Boris Johnson and the people working at Number 10 who were having those parties, when I had friends of mine who were literally saying goodbye to their mothers on FaceTime on their phone because they weren't allowed in to see them. I knew people in care homes where it ripped through and killed a third of the people in the home in two weeks and the desperation that people felt. I had a cousin who lost his father who couldn't go and see his dying wife and so on. It's disgusting. There were terrible stories. It's criminal. Terrible stories. It's disgusting. So let me ask you a question as a professional because we're both adults and we're both very smart. As a professional, which is more likely? That the government believed COVID was deadly and everybody should be truthfully afraid and locked in their houses but because they had this spirit inside of them and they couldn't resist the idea of a party, decided to risk their lives to party or they lied on the television trying to scare everyone and enslave them and lock them in their houses knowing it's garbage, knowing it's a lie and not caring and had a party behind everyone's back so they didn't think they'd get caught. Which one is more likely as a professional, as a logical human? Why don't we just agree that they were a bunch of rank hypocrites, stupid people who were behaving utterly selfishly to the extent that the Queen, when her husband Prince Philip dies, is in the church on her own in a mask with none of her family around her after losing a rock of 70 years and it turned out the night before down the street it had I think two parties including a karaoke party. I think that was shameful and disgraceful. So we can agree on that? We can agree on that and we can wake up and start to realize oh maybe the government doesn't care about us, maybe the government lies to us, maybe they tell us things and try and scare us but they don't actually care themselves. Maybe all they are is hypocritical self-interested people. Maybe they are. And maybe they use the MSM to purport their lies to keep everybody enslaved while they do whatever they want and that is the matrix in and of itself and if you speak against it and people listen to you, I'll repeat this, your ability to speak freely is directly correlated to your insignificance. If you're as big as I was, the most googled man on the planet telling the truth, you will pay the price Pierce and that is why I was locked in that cell and I do not regret it because I live true to God. I'm not going to sit here as a coward and not tell the truth to people for as long as I live until they put a bullet in my head. Let me ask you about the lover boy method. So the suggestion is that you and your brother and others but let's talk about you, that you deploy the lover boy method where you would make women fall in love with you, you would then persuade them to do webcam stuff right? TikTok. Okay but wait, let's call it webcam stuff right? No, let's not call it that, the indictment is about TikTok. Okay what would you make the women do or what would they do with you? I don't make anybody do anything. In fact, let's talk about the lover boy method. So it's very interesting. Let's imagine the Matrix is pissed off with a said individual who's telling too much truth and everybody is listening to him and they decide they're gonna attack him with sexual assault claims. They say, ah he's making women do, well we found conversations where he gave advice on how to go viral on TikTok. He's making women do TikTok but he isn't being horrible to them, he's not hitting them, he's not being mean to them, so what can we do? Let's use the lover boy method. If I was abusive and mean they wouldn't say lover boy method. You know what lover boy method means? Being nice. He was nice and polite and kind and they really liked him as a person and he told them how to do TikTok. He's a lover boy. Of course it is. Andrew, that's not what the lover boy method is. Absolutely it is. The lover boy method is where perpetrators woo victims with the prospect of a loving relationship until they can be forced into abusive situations or a form of slavery. This is garbage. That's actually what it means. The lover boy method is being nice to people so that you work together, effectively what they're trying to say here. I was nice to girls who asked me for TikTok advice and they say it's the lover boy method. I didn't beat them into doing TikTok, I didn't force them, I didn't threaten them. In fact, I was like, yeah you're very pretty, you can be pretty famous. Was there any element of coercion? How can there be an element? What does that even mean? Let's be professionals here. What does that even mean? What do you think coercion means? I was coerced into this interview. You came along to me and said. You weren't coerced into this interview. Yes I was. Well don't tell me the bullying MSM said, Andrew you've got to do an interview. No. And I'm gonna fly all the way to Romania to do it. You didn't do that. You used the lover boy method. You said, sir. The lover boy method. Yep. Andrew, this is gonna be a very interesting interview. We had a good one last time. You're a nice guy. We have some interesting conversations. I didn't say you were a nice guy. I'm gonna come along. Wait a minute, wait a minute. We're gonna make some money from this interview. Wait a minute. Money will be made for both sides. Wait a minute. You lover boyed me and you stole the profit. Just to be clear, I've had no conversation with you about this interview. And the conversations I've had with your intermediary were very professional. And I said, I would like to do an interview with you. Were you nice? Of course, I'm always nice. Lover boyed. You can't believe you used niceness to lover boy me because this is a profitable enterprise and I was coerced here. I make no pretense that I'm into, I've come all the way from London to Romania to interview you. Because yes, I want to do it on my show. And that will clearly benefit me and my show. Am I a full grown consenting adult who decided to do this show? Am I a full grown consenting adult who decided to do this show? Yes. Okay, so I wasn't coerced, correct? But what's that got to do with what I've asked you? Because you were nice to me. And you're saying that. I wasn't nice to you. I didn't even talk to you. Being nice is the lover boy method and that adults have no personal responsibility. I wasn't nice to somebody else. I wasn't nice to someone. They become your slave. I wasn't nice to you and I didn't call you a nice guy. I feel lover boyed. I feel lover boyed. I'm sorry. Well, I'm sorry. It's fine. You had a website, Hustlers University, offering courses teaching husbands and boyfriends how to get their partners into webcam. Absolutely false. The Hustlers University, which you can go to now, actually, we've changed the domain, it's university.com, is a school which teaches modern wealth creation methods. We teach people how to make websites. We teach people e-comm. Why did you call it a PhD pimping hose degree? No, you're talking about an old video which was made satirically. Why did you call it that? Oh, that was satire. Of course it was. Nine years ago, the internet was a very different place. And if you're going to sit here and say, oh, nine years ago, you said stupid things on the internet. It's not a gotcha moment because every single person has. So have you. So have you because you advocated for the vaccine, sir. So you said stupid things on the internet. That's how things go. It's satirical. I also said I'm an astronaut. Do you believe I've been to the moon? Because I haven't, believe it or not. Hustlers University teaches children how to make websites. There's only one reason I'm asking you. The only reason I'm asking you, you've repeatedly said in interviews since you were arrested that you have never categorized yourself as a pimp. You don't think you're a pimp, right? Well, what about all the rappers? Did you ask Ice Cube if he's a pimp and a murderer and a drug dealer? JTZ sold crack. I'm not interviewing them. I'm asking you whether you have at any stage in the last 15 years been a pimp. Of course I've not been a pimp. I've said I'm a pimp. I've said I'm an astronaut. I've said I'm a cowboy. I've said I'm the strongest man in the world. I've said I'm the greatest. I've said I'm James Bond. Throw me in jail. I deserve it. Nine years ago, I made a joke on the internet. So here's my question. Are you a fantasist? I'm not a fantasist. Do you have a persona that's just not you? Of course not. I am me. Well, if you are you, why would you repeatedly call yourself a pimp and then now say you've never been a pimp? Are you going to sit here and say that because I've once said, oh. I'm curious whether you're trying to say to me, you didn't mean any of the things you said. So I'm asking myself, well, why should I believe anything you say now? In other words, is what you say actually what you mean? Is Andrew Tate real or do you have a complete persona that you've fuelled for money that has nothing to do with the real you? I don't know. You tell me. I exaggerated on the internet nine years ago for comedic effect. I'd walk into a nightclub and there'd be girls at my table, like every other man who walks into a nightclub, and I'd say, pimpin'. Oh, no. Put me in jail. 93 days was not enough with the cockroaches. I should go back. This is a matrix attack, Pierce. Every single person, every single man out there has done things worse than I've done. In fact, I will argue, if you put 99.9% of men through the level of scrutiny I've been through by multiple federal agencies, you will find a lot worse than him saying he was a pimp on the internet nine years ago. You will find actual genuine crime. And I've done nothing. I live true to God. This is all garbage and it's not real. Like I said to you, I don't know if you're guilty or not. I do. I am not guilty. It's a matrix attack. I want to be clear to you, I'm not pre-empting your guilt. I've come here with a completely open mind. You've been charged with serious offences, but I am not going to judge you because I'm not a judge. This is not a courtroom. But it's interesting to me that one of the biggest charges against you is that you're a misogynist. And you've always said, I'm not a misogynist. And the last time I interviewed you, you said, well, I may have said some things that may have been misconstrued. But even in the last week, you've tweeted some stuff, which I'm not even sure if you're aware as you tweet this stuff, how it sounds. Read it. Okay, let's read. This is quite a long one. Sure. But I think it's important to read it to get a sense of how you view women. Absolutely. Any woman I date does not have a job. Okay, so the woman you're with doesn't have a job? No. Okay. Do you date other women? Sometimes. And your partner's fine with that? Obviously. Yeah. And you're fine with that? Why wouldn't I be? You think it's fine to be dating other women when you have a mother and a kid? I think we're consenting adults and everybody can make their own personal decisions. Okay, fair enough. Why would I be working so hard, you say, to have hundreds of millions from my woman to waste her life in slaved pennies? No, I will give you a life you can never, ever afford. Private jets, five-star hotels, new cars, endless spending money and diamonds. You'll be rich because you're praying for me every day and protecting my spirit. I work in the physical world. She works in the spirit realm. Women shouldn't have to work because being a good partner is a full-time job for a woman. She has to look good. All the beauty treatments are time-intensive. Not about money, it takes a lot of time. She has to train every day and stay in fantastic shape. Shops look amazing next to me. I know there are some men who do a hundred times more than this on a daily basis, but women are not as organized as men. And achieving anything significant causes them huge amounts of stress. They need to have huge sections of their day empty to waste or they will have a mental breakdown. And do you want a woman who's stressed and angry after the commute, unshaven and exhausted? Or do you want a Barbie doll who's always smiling and saying thank you because she did her nails and brought you proud of that day? As a man, unless you're a loser, you're already filthy rich, right? You can get endless sex anyway. Girls are easy. So what can a girl give you? Happiness, vibes, always smiling. Take the edge off a stressful life. Can she always be happy if she's been working all day? No. Just to wake up at 11, gym till 1, one appointment and some shopping. Dress beautiful by 7pm for you to finish working and tell you how strong you are. No matter how pissed off you are, just to always be laughing and smiling and writing little notes about how you're perfect. And just to be playful and funny. She can't do that if she has a job. So your job is being my girlfriend and now you're a millionaire. Congratulations. Behave and aim for the promotion to wife. The reason I read all that in detail was, I don't think you understand quite how that comes over. Because I think that is the purest definition of misogyny I've probably ever read. Well, I don't think you understand. One, especially when I'm talking about the fact that women can't handle what men can do, etc. One, it's slightly sarcastic. There's a sarcastic tone. Do you mean any of this? I mean all of it. Any woman I'm with, I will provide for. No woman should work. They should spend all day beautifying themselves for you, right? And they make you promoted to wife. Your job is being my girlfriend. There are hundreds of millions of women around the world who do a good day's work, who still manage to be a very good wife or partner. Agreed. Completely. So why would you encourage a whole generation of young men? I mean, I've got to be honest, since our last two interviews, before you were arrested, I would say every single day, I have young men, teenage boys, maybe early 20s, coming up to me asking about you. It's gone on every day since I interviewed you. I'm very aware of your reach. I'm very aware of your influence. And whenever I've been asked about you, they say, what do you think of him? I said, I don't really know. I find myself agreeing with 60 to 70% of the things you say. And I do. Because I think a lot of the stuff you say about empowering young men to be confident, to work out, to take care of themselves. To have enough money to not force their woman to work. Right. That's the bit. That's the bit where when you stray into that kind of language, particularly in the detail, where you reveal what you're really thinking. A, the kind of pathetic, soulless life you want for these women. Where does it allow for being a mother, for example? Absolutely. How does a mother of your children manage to find time for being a mother in this routine of love and devotion to you? How does having a job give her time to be a mother? This gives her all the time in the world to be a mother. One, it's slightly sarcastic. Firstly. What do you mean? You've been told by the tone. Do you mean you don't mean it? No, I mean it. But it's slightly sarcastic. Well, sarcasm means you don't mean it. No, I mean it. But it's slightly sarcastic. You either mean it or you don't. It's either sarcastic or it's not. I mean every single word. But this is a conundrum with you, Andrew. This is the conundrum with you, right? It's not a conundrum. If you'd let me explain, it's not a conundrum at all. You tweet this. I tweet this out. I get thousands of women begging me, inboxing me saying, finally a man who understands he needs to provide for a woman so she can be her best self. Right. That's exactly the kind of life that will allow you to be a mother. There are definitely women that will absolutely love to be treated like this. Are they misogynists? No, but what I think they are, they're people who just basically, it's the old sugar daddy thing, right? They want to have a rich guy who's going to pamper them and take care of them. They don't have to do a day's work. They just have to make themselves look good to you. Being a good partner is a day's work. Well, so you say. Yeah. But it also, the language that you use here seriously diminishes women who do work. You make them out to be, well, you're not doing your job as a partner or wife. You should be doing your job, which is just to devote yourself to his pleasure and making him happy. Well, it's actually interesting you say that because I'll put a lot of the fault of this on men. Let's, if you want to gender the argument, let's do that. I think that a lot of the reason why women can't live this life, if they so choose, if you're a woman who decides to work, then go to work. I don't care. But if you're a woman who decides she wants to retire, it's because she can't find a man who could provide for her at this level. Do you think when a woman marries a billionaire, that she wants to go get a job in Starbucks? Because in my experience, when they marry extremely successful men, they don't want a job. I'm sure Ronaldo's wife isn't begging to go work in Ikea. Actually, Ronaldo's wife works very hard. She works for herself, which is different. And her family. Of course, which is different. She's a hardworking woman. Absolutely. Because being a fantastic partner and having a bunch of children is a bunch of hard work. And she also finds the energy to have businesses on the side. Fantastic. But you don't want women to have businesses. No, I'm saying if you're with a man of my stature, you don't have to work. Now, if I met a perfect woman and we were together and we were happy. When you say a man of your stature, with respect, right now, you have no income, no possessions, and you're facing serious criminal charges. I mean, I'm not quite sure what stature you think you're currently selling, but it ain't great. OK, well, then it's a shame all those women inboxed me after I put that tweet out saying, I don't agree with you. I think you should interview. I met a woman yesterday who, when I said I was coming to interview, was immediately like, oh, can you put a good word in for me? Of course. Sure. You have a definite appeal to a certain type of woman. There's no question. I think providing for a woman financially is a man's responsibility. If that means I'm a misogynist, then I'm a misogynist. I think you accept you are a misogynist. I think a man should provide for a woman financially, completely and utterly. If she wants to work, if my partner were to say to me right now, I really feel like getting a job, it would make me happy, then I'll say work. But she doesn't have to. Her job is looking after the children, looking after me, and being as happy as possible. If you think I'm a bad person for saying, if you actually read that, read the subtext and context. I read it a lot. OK, good. Then you'll understand what I'm saying. You know I did. You heard it. Absolutely. So what I'm saying is, I am a man. My life is stressful. My life is pain. I go to jail. I suffer. I have to deal with making money. I have constant, endless headache. I do all of that so I can give you everything, but then I get to have you. Your job is to be happy. I want you to smile. I want you to look your best and feel your best all of the time. If I'm a misogynist for saying that, I go through so much pain so that we can be financially secure. So I hope the woman I care about does not have to work a job. If that makes me a bad person, then so be it. Because all I'm saying is, I want to take care of her in every single realm. I take care of her physical safety. I take care of her financial security. That is my job as a man. And if more men acted like me, you will see that the world would be a happier and better place. The women who say, I really want to work. I want a career. That's their prerogative and their decision. They're allowed to do that. But often the reason they do that is because they can't find a man they trust to take care of them. I've had this from women in their own house. If I found a man who was financially secure and as smart as you, I wouldn't be doing this garbage job either. Why was I psyoped into working to pay taxes when I should be at home having children with a man I adore? Andrew, Andrew, there are so many women that will listen to that and be laughing and mocking you. Don't be so ridiculous. I have a job that I love. Maybe they're being paid even more than their man, right? The real world isn't the one that you categorize. The real world is varied and nuanced. But I am talking about my life experience. It's a very... My experience. Any woman I love does not have to work unless she decides to. Right. You're the boss. You're in charge. Her job is to make you happy. Her job is to make herself look good. Her job is to work out for your benefit. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It is actually just misogyny. Do you think a woman looking good and working out has no benefit at all to her? Of course it does. Okay. So it's not for my benefit, then is it? Let me see. But when you talk about young men and you tell them to work out and take care of themselves, I cheer you on, right? I want that. I've got three sons. I want them to feel that way. Don't you want them to become very rich and successful? Of course. Have a woman who relies on them and have a beautiful family? No, but I don't want a woman who's subservient to them. Why is subservience? Why is a woman who relies... Literally, the tone of the tweet I read is subservient. You did another tweet this week. Men love by telling you what to do and not allowing you to make stupid decisions. We save you from the female inclination to make stupid choices. If a man doesn't give you instructions, he doesn't love you. If you won't listen to a man's instructions, you don't love him. The whole language is so ridiculous. Let me change the language, then. Well, you tweeted this to 8.2%. 8.2 million people. Correct. So let me say this. A father loves... Let's say instead of a man loves, say a father loves. A father loves disciplinarian. That's how a father will love you. A mother will say, oh, I hope you're happy. Hope you're doing okay. But a father will come along and say, no, don't do this. You must do it that way. That's incorrect. It has to be this way. A father will discipline you because a father feels he knows best for you. It's the masculine essence of love. When a man loves, he shows that he cares via degrees. There is a massive difference between a relationship between a father and a child and between a man and a woman in a relationship. Completely. And I'm not sure you quite get that. No, there is a difference. But I would argue, Piers, I would argue in the happiest relationships, it's a traditionally masculine role in which the man plays and provides. The female is traditionally feminine. The man is the head of the house. Not in an abusive way. Doesn't beat her up. I'm talking about the man being the head of the household, like I would like to believe you're the head of your household. And he comes along and says, what happens and what doesn't happen? Because he's the man of the house. No, that's not how most households operate now. Well, then it sounds like we understand why the entire world's a mess. Because only 10 years ago, that's exactly how the households were operated. There was a man of the house. And now we have no longer any clear defined roles. There's no more longer a man of the house. You want to talk about knife crime, kids doing drugs, the crime rate, all of these problems. You want to talk about all of the societal ills we face. Perhaps it's because we don't have any men in the house anymore. Perhaps we need to bring the man of the house back. And the man of the house will come along and be a disciplinarian. And he will make the set rules and the creeds of that house. He will say, within this household, we don't take drugs. That stands for the woman I am with, the children who we have birthed. Nobody takes drugs in this household because this is my house. And I'm the man of the house. So it sounds to me like we need to bring it back, sir. Yeah, listen, it's all good macho stuff. OK. And I know lots of young boys who listen to this and go, wow, that's how I should be. Then I read the detail of your tweets. And again, come back to this. We save women from their female inclination to make stupid choices. Females are emotional. If a man isn't giving you instructions. Females are emotional. Hang on. He doesn't love you. Females are emotional. All this stuff is designed to, exactly as you just articulated, is designed to make young men feel that the only way they can be successful in life is to effectively have their women under control, give them instructions that they have to obey. Don't buy women Prada and you'll end up in jail. You can buy them Prada. But let me finish my point. My point is that it seems to me from reading your tweets, even now, that you have a blind spot when it comes to how they sound. And it may be that the legal problems that you're in, which might be extremely serious, and we'll see when the trial happens. But it may be that in your head, nothing you've done is remotely inappropriate. Because actually, in your tweets, you can see there's an element there of wanting coercion and control. You want to control women. You want them to be, effectively, your servants. Slaves, for want of a better phrase. Slaves who get Prada and get to work out in the gym and get to look good. But you understand the point I'm making? No, I don't. Which is, in your head, the line is blurred so much now with this macho rhetoric that you've actually lost track of how this sounds. Even when I read that stuff to you, I could see you looking at me and your answer is, I was being sarcastic. And I said, well, where? And then you go, well, no, I meant it. Well, it can't be both. I meant it. And I said, it has a sarcastic tone for comedic effect. You either mean it, or it's, well, no, because sarcasm means you don't mean it. Pierce, all the things you've just described— Do you accept that? You're a smart guy. You know what sarcasm means, right? Absolutely. I said it has a sarcastic tone for comedic effect. All the things I'm saying, and the things I've said, are basically the way the entire world thought only 10 years ago. You may buy into the psy-op. You may buy into the new thing. I don't buy into any psy-ops. We just talked about the vaccine, sir. Yeah, the vaccines weren't psy-ops. Of course not. So I believe that there should be a man of the house— You had a polio vaccine, right? Correct. Why? Because I didn't get polio. I wouldn't have a COVID vaccine because I'd still get COVID, plus probably myocarditis and have a heart attack. So we believe there was a man of the house 10 years ago— Do you think statistically more people got myocarditis by having the vaccine or not having it? I think statistically we need to bring it back. You don't know, do you? Why would I know? Why would I look at the statistics and studies— Why would you bother to— They come from the matrix itself. So the matrix— So every fact you don't like, because it doesn't suit your agenda, you just dismiss as matrix bullshit. No, I'll give you a very simple way I view the world. COVID can't hurt me, so why would I take their injection? You don't have to. Point two. You don't have to take it. They tried to make us, including you. Yeah. You told people they should have the vaccine. You know why? If they don't have it, they shouldn't leave their house. You know why? Because at the time, the scientists— And by the way, scientists is ever-evolving. At the time I said that, the scientists said, if you had the vaccine, it would prevent you transmitting the virus. The matrix— That turned out to be wrong. Because the matrix— And they issued updated advice saying, further studies said that actually you could transmit it. And at that point, you know what I did, which you never do? I held my hands up and went, I was wrong because the advice changed, and now I would not say the same thing. That is called actually evolving opinions when facts change. That's actually how a civilized democracy works. We live in a civilized democracy, do we, sir? I actually would argue that point with you for a very long time. I don't think we live in a civilized democracy. Another point I want to make here, if I had cancer or if I was at threat of a genuine disease which could actually harm me, would the NHS text me 10 times a day trying to get me treatment, or would I be sitting there waiting for eight months to even get an appointment? They wouldn't care about me and they'd let me die. So the fact that they will endlessly text me and try and beg me to get this poison should be an alarm bell for anybody with a brain. Actually, I'll tell you what the NHS has said to me. I'm a 58-year-old man, in the last few months they've sent me one about a flu jab, which I'm going to have because I think it stops you getting flu, and flu's nasty. A COVID booster, which I won't have. I think I've had enough of those. I'm fine with that, thanks.
