Hi Grandpa! Hi! Let's start today's interview, which will be about your childhood. The first question would be, what did you play with until then, or what did you spend your time with? Oh, well, it was very simple then. There weren't as many kinds of opportunities as there are now. When I was a kid, we mostly played in the open space. We played football, roller-skating. We mostly played catch. We mostly played games that didn't require a lot of equipment. Because our parents couldn't afford to buy too many equipment. So we spent our free time with these. I see. Well, that must have been good. My second question would be, what did you eat? Oh, very tasty things. My mother cooked very deliciously, to my liking, and to the liking of my siblings. And we usually cooked dishes that were produced at home. Because at that time our parents had a small barn. We had a garden next to our house, where the fruit and vegetables were grown. Sometimes we went to the market, but usually we made dishes that our parents made, my mother. We could grow them at home, we could prepare them in advance. And she cooked them very deliciously. Well, that's good. And our third question, which is the last question, is, who were your childhood friends? Oh, well, I had several friends. You have to choose between the two. One of them is BÃ©li Utca, where we lived. Those are the children I played with almost day and night, especially in the summer. Secondly, my school friends, with whom I hung out at school. They were very nice friends, they smiled and smiled at us. So I would very much like to go back to them. Thank you very much, Grandpa, for the interview. Have a nice day. Bye, Grandpa. Thank you. Bye.
